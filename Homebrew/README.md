### Export Installed Packages and Taps from the Original Machine

Create a list of installed packages and taps:

- **For Homebrew packages:**

  ```bash
  brew list --formula > Brewfile
  ```

- **For Casks (GUI apps and other binaries):**

  ```bash
  brew list --cask >> Brewfile
  ```

- **For Taps:**
  ```bash
  brew tap > BrewTaps
  ```

### Install Taps and Packages on the New Machine

- **For Taps:**
  Before installing packages, make sure to tap all the repositories from the `BrewTaps` file:

  ```bash
  xargs brew tap < BrewTaps

  ```

- **For Packages:**
  Once the taps are installed, install all packages (both formulae and casks) from the `Brewfile`:
  ```bash
  xargs brew install < Brewfile
  ```
